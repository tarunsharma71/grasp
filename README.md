Grasp is a local MCP server that gives AI agents full browser control through Chrome DevTools Protocol. It creates a dedicated `chrome-grasp` profile where your agent logs in to services once and retains every session permanently — completely separate from your personal browsing.

**Current release:** `v0.1.0`

---

## What Grasp stands for

Browser automation for AI was broken in three ways: sessions never persisted, HTML was too expensive to send to a model, and JS injection got blocked.

Grasp fixed all three — and built the architecture from the ground up for the MCP era.

**Three original contributions:**

**1. The dedicated browser.** Grasp packages the "AI owns its browser" idea as a ready-to-use MCP server. The agent logs in once; every session is saved permanently in `chrome-grasp`. Cloud browsers lose every cookie on shutdown. Local Playwright requires manual persistent context configuration with no MCP-era packaging. Grasp starts logged in — one `npx grasp` to set up everything.

**2. Hint Map.** Instead of dumping raw HTML into the context window, Grasp scans the live viewport and produces a compact semantic map:

```
[B1] Submit order      (button, pos:450,320)
[I1] Coupon code       (input,  pos:450,280)
[L2] Back to cart      (link,   pos:200,400)
```

IDs are fingerprint-stable across calls. Token cost drops 90%+ versus raw HTML. This is Grasp's original perception layer — purpose-built for how models actually reason about UI.

**3. Real events, not injection.** Every click is a mouse curve with randomized timing and landing offset. Every scroll is a sequence of CDP wheel events. Every keystroke has per-character delay. This is not `element.click()` — it is real CDP input that behaves closer to human operation than script injection.

On pages that expose `window.__webmcp__`, Grasp calls native tool APIs directly and skips DOM parsing entirely. On every other page — the vast majority of the web — Hint Map and real events take over automatically. The agent never needs to know which mode it is in.

## Why Grasp exists

Giving AI browser access today comes with three bad options:

| Option | Problem |
|:---|:---|
| Cloud headless browsers (Browserbase, Steel) | Data leaves your machine, no cookies, unreachable on private networks |
| Local Playwright with a new profile | Fresh profile every time, all logins gone, SSO and 2FA fail |
| Page-reading tools | Read-only, cannot interact |

Grasp is the fourth option: a persistent, local, agent-owned browser that starts every task already logged in.

## What ships in this repo

Grasp `v0.1.0` includes:
- an MCP server in `src/server/` with 18 registered tools
- a Chrome bridge and adaptive execution engine in `src/layer1-bridge/`
- a Hint Map perception layer in `src/layer2-perception/`
- a real-event action layer in `src/layer3-action/`
- a CLI in `src/cli/` with `connect`, `status`, and `logs` commands
- an audit log written to `~/.grasp/audit.log`
- a safe mode that intercepts high-risk actions before they fire
- one-click AI client auto-configuration for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor
- a `grasp connect` wizard that bootstraps everything from scratch

## How it works

```
Your chrome-grasp profile (logged in, sessions intact)
         |
         | Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
         |
    Grasp MCP Server
         |
         | MCP stdio
         |
    Your AI Agent (Claude / Codex / Cursor)
```

**Adaptive execution engine** — on every navigation, Grasp probes for WebMCP support in under 50ms. Pages that expose `window.__webmcp__` get native structured tools with zero DOM parsing. All other pages fall back to Hint Map + real event execution.

**Hint Map** — instead of sending raw HTML, Grasp scans the viewport and returns a compact semantic map:

```
[B1] Submit order      (button, pos:450,320)
[I1] Coupon code       (input,  pos:450,280)
[L2] Back to cart      (link,   pos:200,400)
```

Token consumption drops 90%+ compared to raw HTML. IDs are fingerprint-stable across calls.

**Real events, not JS injection** — every click is a mouse curve (15 steps, random landing offset). Every scroll is 5 CDP wheel events with 20–60ms random gaps. Every keystroke has 30–80ms per-character delay.

## Install

### One-click (recommended)

```bash
npx grasp
```

This runs the `grasp connect` wizard: detects Chrome, launches it with a dedicated `chrome-grasp` profile, and auto-configures your AI client.

> First launch: the wizard opens `chrome-grasp`. Log in to any services your agent will use. Sessions are saved permanently in that profile.

### Add to AI client manually

#### Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add grasp -- npx -y grasp
```

#### Claude Desktop / Cursor

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grasp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "grasp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Codex CLI

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.grasp]
type    = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args    = ["-y", "grasp"]
```

### Global install

```bash
npm install -g grasp
grasp connect
```
