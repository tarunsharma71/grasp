> **Grasp is a route-aware AI Browser Runtime for agents. One URL, one best path.**

Grasp runs locally, keeps a dedicated `chrome-grasp` profile, and gives agents a persistent, human-visible, recoverable web runtime instead of disposable tabs and one-off scripts. That dedicated profile is Grasp's runtime boundary, not "whatever local browser window the user happens to have open right now." The product promise in `v0.6.6` is simple: given a URL and an intent, Grasp should choose the best path first, keep that decision explainable, require confirmed runtime context before page-changing actions, continue on the same runtime path, surface the active route boundary directly in high-level tool responses, refuse high-level form/workspace actions when the current surface boundary does not match, and attach a route/surface-aware prompt package agents can actually execute against.

## Where the moat comes from

Anyone can open a page. Very few systems can keep real web work continuous, verifiable, and recoverable.

Grasp compounds around the parts that are hard to fake:

- `Continuity`: tasks survive login state, checkpoint pages, and context switching instead of restarting from scratch
- `Verification`: actions are checked against actual page changes instead of being treated as success by default
- `Recovery`: humans can step in and agents can resume in the same browser context with evidence

That is why Grasp is not just a browser automation wrapper. Over time, that is how a browser runtime becomes the operating layer agents rely on for real web work.

## Route by Evidence

Users should not need to remember whether this URL belongs on a public reader, a live authenticated session, a workspace flow, a real form flow, or a handoff path.

That route choice is the product.

Public modes:

- `public_read`
- `live_session`
- `workspace_runtime`
- `form_runtime`
- `handoff`

Provider choice stays internal. Users and agents should reason about modes and evidence, not about which package or adapter happens to run underneath.

## Proof of the runtime

```text
entry(url, intent)
inspect()
request_handoff(...)
mark_handoff_done()
resume_after_handoff()
continue()
```

If the same task can survive a human step, return to the same browser context, and continue from evidence instead of replaying from scratch, the product has crossed from browser wrapper into runtime.

What it does not claim:

- universal CAPTCHA bypass
- guaranteed full autonomy on every gated site
- evidence-free recovery
- that any one workflow defines the whole product

## Quickstart

### 1. Bootstrap Grasp locally

```bash
npx -y @yuzc-001/grasp
```

This detects Chrome, launches the dedicated `chrome-grasp` profile, and helps you connect your AI client.

By default this connects Grasp's own CDP runtime. Unless you explicitly point it at a different CDP endpoint, it is not claiming control over an arbitrary browser session the user is currently viewing.

If you already have the CLI installed, `grasp connect` does the same local bootstrap step.

Bootstrap also establishes the remote-debugging/CDP connection Grasp needs. In the normal local path, users do not need to prepare that separately.

### 2. Connect your client

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add grasp -- npx -y @yuzc-001/grasp
```

Claude Desktop / Cursor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grasp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@yuzc-001/grasp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Codex CLI:

```toml
[mcp_servers.grasp]
type = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@yuzc-001/grasp"]
```

### 3. Get your first win

Tell your AI to:

1. call `get_status`
2. use `entry` on a real page with an intent such as `extract` or `workspace`
3. call `inspect`, then `extract`, `extract_structured`, or `continue`
4. call `explain_route` or run `grasp explain`

The first win is not just that Grasp opens a page. It is that the agent can choose a route, explain why, and stay inside the same runtime when the task gets real.

## Runtime Workflows

### Real browsing first

Start from the real page and the real session whenever possible. Grasp should read and act on the current browser state before falling back to heavier observation or search-like shortcuts.

### Public read

Use `entry(url, intent="extract")` -> `inspect` -> `extract` when the page is public and already readable.

What you get:

- route decision
- current page status
- readable content
- a suggested next action

### Structured extraction

Use `extract_structured(fields=[...])` when you want the current page converted into a field-based record while staying on the same runtime path.

What you get:

- field-based `record` output
- `missing_fields` when the page does not expose a requested value clearly enough
- field evidence with the matched label and extraction strategy
- JSON export, plus optional Markdown export

Use `extract_batch(urls=[...], fields=[...])` when you want the same structured extraction contract applied across multiple URLs in sequence on the same runtime.

What you get:

- one structured `record` per visited URL
- exported `CSV` and `JSON` artifacts, plus optional Markdown bundle
- per-URL status when a page stays gated or needs handoff instead of pretending the scrape succeeded

### Share layer

Use `share_page(format="markdown" | "screenshot" | "pdf")` when the result needs to be forwarded to someone else without sending them the original inaccessible page link.

What you get:

- a shareable artifact written locally
- a clean share document generated from the current page projection instead of the raw page chrome
- the same runtime explanation path, so the artifact can still be traced back to the page and route that produced it

Use `explain_share_card()` when you want the human-facing share layout explained before exporting it. This uses a Pretext-backed text layout estimate when available, so the share layer can reason about title and summary density without touching the current page DOM.

### Fast-path adapters

Site-specific fast reads no longer need to live inside the core router. `v0.6.3` keeps the built-in BOSS path as an adapter and lets you extend the same mechanism locally.

What is supported:

- drop `.js` adapters into `~/.grasp/site-adapters`
- or point `GRASP_SITE_ADAPTER_DIR` at a different adapter directory
- use a lightweight `.skill` file as a manifest with `entry:` or `adapter:` pointing at a `.js` adapter

A `.js` adapter only needs two capabilities:

- `matches(url)` or `match(url)`
- `read(page)`

The `.skill` file is only a local manifest that points at the adapter entry. It is not a separate runtime layer.

### Live session

Use `entry(url, intent="act")` or `entry(url, intent="workspace")` when the task depends on the current browser session.

`entry` can now surface route evidence such as:

- selected mode
- confidence
- fallback chain
- whether a human is required

### Handoff and resume

When a human step is required, keep the workflow continuous instead of pretending it is fully autonomous:

1. `entry` or `continue` shows the page is gated
2. `request_handoff` records the required human step
3. `mark_handoff_done` marks the step complete
4. `resume_after_handoff` reacquires the page with continuation evidence
5. `continue` decides what should happen next

## Product Model

### How the layers fit

The product is the route-aware Agent Web Runtime itself. `npx -y @yuzc-001/grasp` / `grasp connect` bootstrap it locally, MCP tools expose the public runtime surface, and the skill is the recommended task-facing layer on top of the same runtime.

For the canonical delivery-surface mapping, see [Browser Runtime for Agents](./docs/product/browser-runtime-for-agents.md).

### Modes, not providers

Grasp keeps a single agent-facing interface. The core promise is not a collection of site integrations; it is that any real webpage can be entered, routed, and worked through the same task model.

The public surface should expose modes, not provider names:

- `public_read`
- `live_session`
- `workspace_runtime`
- `form_runtime`
- `handoff`

Provider and adapter choice stays internal. In this slice, `Runtime Engine` remains first-class and `Data Engine` remains a thin read seam for public-web extraction without claiming a fully delivered separate backend.

---

## Real Forms

When the page is a real form, use the specialized form surface:

`form_inspect` -> `fill_form` / `set_option` / `set_date` -> `verify_form` -> `safe_submit`

The default behavior is conservative:

- `fill_form` only writes safe fields
- `review` and `sensitive` fields stay visible so you can inspect them explicitly
- `safe_submit` starts with preview, so you can check blockers before any real submit

Form surface reference: [docs/reference/mcp-tools.md](./docs/reference/mcp-tools.md)

---

## Authenticated Workspaces

Use `workspace_inspect` to inspect a dynamic authenticated workspace and let it suggest the
next step. A typical loop is `workspace_inspect -> select_live_item -> workspace_inspect ->
draft_action -> workspace_inspect -> execute_action -> verify_outcome`. By default Grasp drafts
first, requires explicit confirmation for irreversible actions, and verifies that the workspace
really moved to the next state.

Workspace surface reference: [docs/reference/mcp-tools.md](./docs/reference/mcp-tools.md)

These workspace flows are examples of the browser runtime in use. BOSS is one example, and the same runtime direction also covers surfaces such as WeChat Official Accounts and Xiaohongshu without collapsing the whole product into any one workflow.

### Basic parallel task state

Grasp does not promise a large scheduler today, but it is moving toward handling more than one task/session context without collapsing everything into one active browser assumption.

---

## Advanced Runtime Primitives

The runtime surface is the public default. The lower-level runtime is still available when you need tighter control.

Common advanced primitives:

- navigation and state: `navigate`, `get_status`, `get_page_summary`
- visible runtime tabs: `list_visible_tabs`, `select_visible_tab`
- interaction map: `get_hint_map`
- verified actions: `click`, `type`, `hover`, `press_key`, `scroll`
- observation: `watch_element`
- session strategy and handoff helpers: `preheat_session`, `navigate_with_strategy`, `session_trust_preflight`, `suggest_handoff`, `request_handoff_from_checkpoint`, `request_handoff`, `mark_handoff_in_progress`, `mark_handoff_done`, `resume_after_handoff`, `clear_handoff`
